## Stock Market Standard Dev

We are analysts at the fintech company `Godel Trading`. With the news of the changing market, the company wants to consolidate it's investments and see how volatile `META` and `AMZN`.

We have 2 list of lists describing the closing price of these stocks for every day for the past 10 weeks (09/07 - 11/16). 

Write up code that will calculate the population standard deviation of these 2 companies for each week and print out your results.

## Step 0

Create a GitHub repository of this project and clone it to your computer.

## Step 1

Create an additional file `analysis.py` (feel free to name this however you'd like). This will be your file containing all of your code.

## Step 2

Within `analysis.py`, iterate through each week of each company, and calculate standard deviation of each stock. Print out these values with descriptive strings so that we could view how standard deviation is behaving.

## Step 3

Modify your `README.md` with a short descriptor of your project.

## Step 4

Git add, commit, and push your changes. You will be submitting a link to your GitHub project.

## Challenge 1 (Optional)

Create your own population standard deviation function from the ground up. No usage of the `statistics` module.

## Challenge 2 (Optional)

Graph the standard deviations of each company. What do you notice about each stock's volatility?
